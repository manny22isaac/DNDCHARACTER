# DND Dungeon Master

## Character Info Program
This program will help you get started with your DND game. 

The purpose is to help the DND master guide collect info from the users and then orchestrate the game a little clearly.
Using a dictionary, users can enter in basic information about their character.
Example:

```
characterinfo = {'name':[], 'race':[], 'age':[], 'bio':[],
                 'alignment':[], 'classLevel':[]} 
```
